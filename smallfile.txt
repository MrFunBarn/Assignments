the tributes 
 
when i wake up the other side of the bed is cold my 
fingers stretch out seeking prims warmth but finding 
only the rough canvas cover of the mattress she 
must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our 
mother of course she did this is the day of the 
reaping 
i prop myself up on one elbow theres enough light in 
the bedroom to see them my little sister prim curled 
up on her side cocooned in my mothers body their 
cheeks pressed together in sleep my mother looks 
younger still worn but not so beatendown prims 
face is as fresh as a raindrop as lovely as the 
primrose for which she was named my mother was 
very beautiful once too or so they tell me 
sitting at prims knees guarding her is the worlds 
ugliest cat mashedin nose half of one ear missing 
eyes the color of rotting squash prim named him 
buttercup insisting that his muddy yellow coat 
matched the bright flower i le hates me or at least 
distrusts me even though it was years ago i think he 
still remembers how i tried to drown him in a bucket 
when prim brought him home scrawny kitten belly 
swollen with worms crawling with fleas the last 
thing i needed was another mouth to feed but prim 
begged so hard cried even i had to let him stay it 
turned out okay my mother got rid of the vermin and 
hes a born mouser even catches the occasional rat 
sometimes when i clean a kill i feed buttercup the 
entrails he has stopped hissing at me 
entrails no hissing this is the closest we will ever 
come to love 
 
i swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting 
boots supple leather that has molded to my feet i 
pull on trousers a shirt tuck my long dark braid up 
into a cap and grab my forage bag on the table 
under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats 
and cats alike sits a perfect little goat cheese 
wrapped in basil leaves prims gift to me on reaping 
day i put the cheese carefully in my pocket as i slip 
outside 
our part of district 12 nicknamed the seam is 
usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the 
morning shift at this hour men and women with 
hunched shoulders swollen knuckles many who 
have long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust 
out of their broken nails the lines of their sunken 
faces but today the black cinder streets are empty 
shutters on the squat gray houses are closed the 
reaping isnt until two may as well sleep in if you 
can 
our house is almost at the edge of the seam i only 
have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field 
called the meadow separating the meadow from the 
woods in fact enclosing all of district 12 is a high 
chainlink fence topped with barbedwire loops in 
theory its supposed to be electrified twentyfour 
hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live 
in the woods — packs of wild dogs lone cougars 
bears — that used to threaten our streets but since 
were lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in 
the evenings its usually safe to touch even so i 
always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum 
that means the fence is live right now its silent as a 
stone concealed by a clump of bushes i flatten out 
on my belly and slide under a twofoot stretch thats 
been loose for years there are several other weak 
spots in the fence but this one is so close to home i 
almost always enter the woods here 
 
as soon as im in the trees i retrieve a bow and 
sheath of arrows from a hollow log electrified or not 
the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh 
eaters out of district 12 inside the woods they roam 
freely and there are added concerns like venomous 
snakes rabid animals and no real paths to follow 
but theres also food if you know how to find it my 
father knew and he taught me some before he was 
blown to bits in a mine explosion there was nothing 
even to bury i was eleven then five years later i still 
wake up screaming for him to run 
even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and 
poaching carries the severest of penalties more 
people would risk it if they had weapons but most 
are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife 
my bow is a rarity crafted by my father along with a 
few others that i keep well hidden in the woods 
carefully wrapped in waterproof covers my father 
could have made good money selling them but if the 
officials found out he would have been publicly 
executed for inciting a rebellion most of the 
peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who 
hunt because theyre as hungry for fresh meat as 
anybody is in fact theyre among our best 
customers but the idea that someone might be
